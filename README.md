A simple admin panel that integrates into existing Node + Express + MySQL/MariaDB applications.

# Deprecated

**This project will most likely not receive any more updates.** If anyone would like to mantain it, contact [MrXyfir](https://github.com/MrXyfir).

# Features

- View databases on provided MySQL/MariaDB server
- View tables within a database
- View a table's structure
- View, search, edit, insert, and remove rows within a table
- Ability to write, run, and see the results of your own custom SQL queries

This panel is currently very simple and limited in what it is able to do. Feel free to implement new features as you need them and create a pull request.

# Setup

**WARNING!** Some setup is required. This is not a standalone admin panel that you install and run a couple commands. It was built to integrate directly into your existing application so as to give you more control over it. How you integrate it into your existing Express + MySQL application is largely up to you.
